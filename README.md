This section covers the Linked List data structure, an essential concept in Java that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

Definition and Structure: Explained Linked List as a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node, forming a chain-like structure.

Types of Linked Lists: Discussed various types, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, highlighting their unique features and use cases.

Basic Operations: Demonstrated key operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, providing examples for both singly and doubly linked lists.

Advantages and Disadvantages: Analyzed the benefits of Linked Lists over arrays, such as dynamic sizing and ease of element manipulation, as well as their drawbacks, like increased memory usage and slower access times.

Practical Applications: Provided examples of real-world applications, including implementing stacks and queues, and managing dynamic datasets where frequent insertions and deletions are required.
